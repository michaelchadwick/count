# Count

Simple RubyGem that counts the number of characters in a string and displays it. Make sure to escape any quotes (`\'`) or double-quotes (`\"`) (if'n your string has something quoted, for example) so that they are included in the overall count.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'count'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install count

## Usage

`count string`
