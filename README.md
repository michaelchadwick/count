# Countr

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/countr.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/countr)

A simple RubyGem that counts the number of characters in a string and displays it.

*NOTE:* Make sure to escape any quotes (`\\'`) or double-quotes (`\\"`) (if'n your string has something quoted, for example) so that they are included in the overall count.

## Usage

`countr STRING`  

Examples:
* Tweet length:  
  `$ countr \@username and then I said \"OMG this new rubygem called \'countr\' is super-cool!\"`  
* Arbitrary sentence:  
  `$ countr Sundry items have a way of creeping into your subconscious, whether your mind lingered on them for long or not.`
